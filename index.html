            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Chris Hicks, and this is a platform where I share my ongoing struggle to be an active and loving father in my daughter Nova's life. This journey has been marred by systemic obstacles and deeply troubling behaviours from those entrusted with her care.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Despite my unwavering commitment to my daughter, I face daily barriers erected by Anouck Vigneau, her family, and their support network. Their actions, rooted in prejudice and cruelty, have created a hostile environment that keeps us apart and inflicts harm on both Nova and me.</p>
            <p>My goal is to shed light on these injustices, documenting the hardships we endure and advocating for a fair and compassionate resolution. This site will serve as a hub for evidence, updates, and calls to action. I believe that by sharing our experiences, we can inspire change and ensure that Nova's rights—and the rights of every child—are protected.</p>
